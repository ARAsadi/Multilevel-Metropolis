# Multilevel Metropolis

Load mnist.mat into MATLAB (or Octave), then run MNIST_Data.m and then run Multilevel_Metropolis.m .

The mnist.mat file is made by first installing the following packages:

```pip3 install scipy numpy matplotlib```

and then, by downloading the four gz files from [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/),

and running mnist.py (obtained from [https://github.com/daniel-e/mnist_octave](https://github.com/daniel-e/mnist_octave)).
